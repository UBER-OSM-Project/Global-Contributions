# Global Contributions to Open Street Map
Uber is also contributing to a broader range of mapping features around the world to enrich the OSM basemap. This global effort enhances not only Uberâ€™s own navigation and routing systems but also benefits the wider OSM community.

Key areas of focus include:

 1. Updating road networks: improving geometry, road classes, names, turn restrictions, and directionality.
 2. Adding detailed lane information: including turn lanes and lane connectivity.
 3. Enhancing transportation infrastructure: mapping signposts, shields, and key transit features.
 4. To ensure the accuracy of edits, sources such as recent aerial imagery, street-level photography, and other locally recommended community references are reviewed. Only edits that are clearly supported by these sources are uploaded to OpenStreetMap (OSM)

By contributing high-quality, verified data to OSM, we aim to support more accurate navigation, better trip planning, and a more comprehensive global map experience.
